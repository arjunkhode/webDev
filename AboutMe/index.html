				<h3>About me</h3>
			</div>
			<ul class="qa">
				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Who am I?</li>
				<li class="a">I'm a front-end web developer first and musician, artist and poet after.</li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What's my passion?</li>
				<li class="a">I love javascript. I'm learning front-end programming as a full time commitment and enjoying every bit of it. I've always been fascinated by computers and designing the pretty things that appear on the screen has always been a dream for me. Besides that, I love to play with the sounds a computer makes, i.e music production. I play guitar and sing too. Here's my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/arjun-khode">Soundcloud </a></li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What did I study?</li>
				<li class="a">I studied computer engineering in my undergrad from Pune University. I then moved to USA to study masters in software engineering from the University of California Irvine. </li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Where did I work?</li>
				<li class="a">I have been a part of Bytes System, Nasik as a web developer and of Super Simple Software as a software engineer</li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What can I do?</li>
				<li class="a">As a software engineer at Super simple software, I throroughly studied the workings of Odoo inside-out and then led a team of 4 developers through two projects. Currently, I'm a teaching assistant for the software engineering undergrad course at UCI. I can code in <strong>python, HTML, CSS, javascript, PHP and jQuery</strong>. I have presented our product to a couple of companies as an employee of SSS and I have also hosted a set of videos explaining how various modules of Super Simple ERP work. Videos can be found <a href="http://www.supersimpleerp.com/">here</a>.</li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What was my favorite project I've worked on?</li>
				<li class="a">I developed the complete front-end for a search engine for the Information retrieval course at UCI. Given a web crawler API, we built a search engine from scratch. I enjoyed every bit of coding in PHP and presenting our hard work in a beautiful, easy to use GUI. I integrated my front end seamlessly with python back-end. I coded the TF-IDF part in python too.</li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What was my least favorite project I've worked on?</li>
				<li class="a">The restaurant management module for Odoo was my least favorite project. The requirements in this project were not clear, because of which, my bosses were expecting too many features in our product. It was almost impossible to implement it all based on the knowledge and resoures we had.</li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What did I do about the problem above?</li>
				<li class="a">I firstly made elementary assumptions about the product that were not so obvious. I clearheadedly considered the possible solutions for the features I listed down. Then, I met with my bosses and explained to them what was possible and what was not. I also asked them to try and give me more requirements as I did not have a chance to talk to our customer in person.</li>


				<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What do I know?</li>
				<li class="a">As a software engineer at a brand new startup for more than a year, I closely worked on ERP systems learning how ERP systems work. Bill of materials, manufacturing, purchase, sales, retail, point of sale, workflow, you name it, I've worked on it.</li>
